  "description": "Luka Dončić plays with zero remorse. He hits game winners without breaking a sweat and leaves defenders looking clueless—and he never feels bad about it. So what sort of shoes do you design for someone like that? They've got to be comfortable with firm support—ideal for step-backs, euro steps and playing bully ball in the post. Flightwire cables. IsoPlate. Cushlon foam. Air Zoom unit. It's all got to be in there. In short, you've got to give a bad man some really nice shoes."
